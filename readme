#### start from these files 
config.dk: include most of the paths of input/output files, parameters to use in the program. 
           used by Yu in Denmark, to test data mapped to hg19.
                  (@C: means mentioned parameters can be found in this config file)
qsub_dk.py: call programs or write commands to submit to cluster
	    most program has input like this:
            debug/program_to_call config.dk (option) (pn_idx)
	    eg: "debug/alu_insert config.dk alu_mate_flag 0" call alu_insert with 
                option "alu_mate_flag" for the 0th PN in the (@C)file_pn

config.decode: used by Yu in Iceland, where the old files sitting

#### alu insertion (alu_insert.cpp)
1. alu_insert.cpp  (5 steps )
   opt = "write_tmps_pn": 
       write results: (@C)file_alu_insert0
       for each pn, scan the genome and find potention loci for alu insertion, this generate a lot of temporary files. 
       *tmp1 files can be ignored after this step
       *tmp1, reads mapped at dif chrn or far away
       *tmp1.chr1, result of *tmp1, where one end is mapped to alu 
       *tmp3, left_alu_cnt + right_alu_cnt >= 4 is considered. 
       *tmp3st, subset of *tmp3, with pos in repetitive regions are excluded 
       
   opt = "combine_pos_pns" :
        write results: (@C)file_alu_insert1
        find common insertion positions of multiple individuals
        Note: some PNs with extreme large amount of reads (that might be alu mate). (almost 10 times of other PNs)
              eg: MXQBTEO, HYKJEJS, EIVHBDQ, KSRDJGR
              EITHER:  > 4G memory to fun; OR: ignore them
              I chose to ignore them. For each chromosome, about 15% individuals with extremely high potential insert positions are ignored. 
	
   opt = "clipReads_pn":
     for each pn, write the broken reads at these insertion positions to files at insert_alu1/clip0/chr1/pn
     a read is considered as broken reads only if cigar string shows soft clip, AND the score of realignment is high.

   opt = "clipReads_pns":
     write files at,        insert_alu1/clip0/chr1_pos/regionBegin_regionEnd
     exact position at,     insert_alu1/clip0/chr1.clip_pn
     all broken reads with insertion between regionBegin and regionEnd are written into corresponding files. 

   opt = "write_tmp0_pn":
    insert_alu1/cons/chr*/pn.aludb
    insert_alu1/cons/chr*/pn.clip

todo: add qName for alu_and_clip_read


   opt = "clipPos_pns":
     (1) re_write alu and clip reads in folder insert_alu1/cons/chr*_pos/
     (2) write exact breakpoint at:  insert_alu1/cons/chr0_clip_pass 

   opt = "write_tmp2_pn":
     (1) write "*.tmp1" files, count of aluRead and clipRead, by reading **insert_alu1/cons/chr*/pn.aludb
     (2) write "*.tmp2" files

        calculate likelihood from previous    


   opt = "fixed_vcf_pns":  	 
     combine results and write big vcf
